      <br>
      <strong><p>I was born in Mexico city, my mom is my greatest hero,
        because even though she was asingle mother, she never gave up on us,
        and she thaught me her work ethic.
       I have 1 brother and 1 sister.
      <br>  Because of the lack of oportunities I went to seek a better life in
        The United States, where I lived in California, New York, and Texas for 28 years. I love The Dallas Cowboys and The Dallas Mavericks.
        <br > I am married and I have 3 kids. The oldest is JJ (where I got my nick name) He is my hero
        When he was born he changed my life. <br>I have two daughters Kimberly Kay and Maida
        They are the reason why I do what I do, they inspire me.
